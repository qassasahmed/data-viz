# Python Data Science Libraries Introduction

## Python Collections Overview

Python provides several built-in data structures (collections) that are essential for data manipulation and analysis:

### Basic Python Collections

**Lists**
- Ordered, mutable collections that can store different data types
- Example: `[1, 2, 3, 'hello', True]`
- Use when you need an ordered sequence that can be modified

**Tuples**
- Ordered, immutable collections
- Example: `(1, 2, 3, 'hello')`
- Use when you need an ordered sequence that won't change

**Dictionaries**
- Unordered collections of key-value pairs
- Example: `{'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}`
- Use when you need to associate keys with values

**Sets**
- Unordered collections of unique elements
- Example: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- Use when you need to store unique values or perform set operations

## Data Science Libraries Comparison

| Feature | NumPy | Pandas | Seaborn |
|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Primary Purpose** | Numerical computing with arrays | Data manipulation and analysis | Statistical data visualization |
| **Main Data Structure** | ndarray (N-dimensional array) | DataFrame and Series | Built on matplotlib |
| **Best For** | Mathematical operations, linear algebra | Data cleaning, transformation, analysis | Creating statistical plots |
| **Data Types** | Homogeneous numerical data | Mixed data types (numbers, strings, dates) | Uses pandas DataFrames for input |
| **Performance** | Very fast for numerical operations | Fast for data operations | Moderate (focused on visualization) |
| **Memory Usage** | Very efficient | Efficient for structured data | Depends on underlying data |
| **Learning Curve** | Moderate | Moderate to steep | Easy to moderate |

### When to Use Each Library

**NumPy**
- Mathematical calculations and operations
- Working with arrays and matrices
- Scientific computing tasks
- Foundation for other libraries

**Pandas**
- Reading and writing data files (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data aggregation and grouping
- Time series analysis
- Data exploration and analysis

**Seaborn**
- Creating statistical visualizations
- Exploring data distributions
- Correlation analysis
- Publication-ready plots with minimal code
- Built-in statistical functions for plotting

### Typical Workflow

1. **Import data** using Pandas
2. **Clean and preprocess** data using Pandas
3. **Perform calculations** using NumPy (if needed)
4. **Visualize results** using Seaborn
5. **Analyze patterns** and draw conclusions

### Installation

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

### Basic Import Convention

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

This combination of libraries provides a powerful toolkit for data science projects, from data loading and manipulation to analysis and visualization.
